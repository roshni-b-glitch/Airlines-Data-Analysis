✈️ Airlines Data Analysis Project
📌 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to uncover insights and identify opportunities to increase occupancy rates in low-performing flights, which can significantly improve airline profitability.

📊 Project Overview
In this data analysis project, I explore airline travel data stored in a SQLite database. By utilizing SQL queries in conjunction with Python (pandas, matplotlib), the project extracts meaningful patterns and trends to support strategic business decisions.

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

SQLite (SQL Queries)
